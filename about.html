<h1>About</h1>

<h2>Hey there,</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the site. I'm a developer in the rainy land of Southwest Florida. 
    I'm a programmer, a bit of a designer, and a guy who really likes the web.
    I love <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>. They are my weapons 
    of choice and what I'll be talking about the most on this blog, but don't be
    surprised to see articles on <strong>VIM</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, or 
    whatever else. There is a lot of fun stuff out there to talk about.
<p>


<h2>Things I like</h2>
<p>
    I don't care what anyone else says, I like sharing the cool stuff I find and
    no one can stop me. Here are just a couple of things/places that I think are
    really awesome.
</p>

<h4><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a></h4>
<p>
    Jekyll is a cool tool for creating websites, blogs, or whatever without the 
    need for a database or some complex server-side setup. It's really awesome, 
    and what I'm using for the blog on this site.
</p>

<h4><a href="http://trentwalton.com">Trent Walton's blog</a></h4>
<p>
    Besides being one of the neatest blogs I've ever seen, every post on Trent
    Walton's blog is <em>always</em> chock full of insightful information. He
    covers a wide range of topics, and really makes me think about the approach
    that I take in web-design.
</p>

<h4><a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design</a></h4>
<p>
    The Atomic Design structure is really great, and I'm loving using it. It's
    a way of structuring your sass (or css) that makes everything really easy to
    find. I can hardly think of a better way to go about organizing the styles
    for a large project.
