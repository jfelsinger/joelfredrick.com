<h1>About</h1>

<h2>Hey There,</h2>

<p>
    Welcome to the site. I'm a developer in the rainy land of Southwest Florida. 
    I'm a programmer, a bit of a designer, and a guy who really likes the web.
    I love <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>. They are my weapons 
    of choice and what I'll be talking about the most on this blog, but don't be
    surprised to see articles on <strong>VIM</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, or 
    whatever else. There is a lot of fun stuff out there to talk about.
<p>
