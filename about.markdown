#About

Hey there, Welcome to the site. I'm a developer, writer, and self-proclaimed
cool dude living in sunny southwest Florida. I've been working with the web and
related technologies for a little over three years now, and have gotten my hands 
dirty in everything from asp.net to node.js. I love the web as a platform as 
well as building awesome stuff on top of it. I also love to hear from people, so
feel free to [drop me a line](/contact.html) some time.

'll for the real world. In other words, if it's on the web I'll make it 
work for you, and I'll make it awesome.

#### SEO &amp; Content Strategy

how important your mobile presence is. I craft all of my sites and 
web-applications with mobile devices in mind. All of my creations are 
responsive from the start and tested thoroughly on multiple devices.
