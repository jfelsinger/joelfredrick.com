#About

##Hey there,

Welcome to the site. I'm a developer in the rainy land of Southwest Florida. 
I'm a programmer, a bit of a designer, and a guy who really likes the web.
I love **CSS** and **HTML**. They are my weapons of choice and what I'll be 
talking about the most on this blog, but don't be surprised to see articles 
on **VIM**, **Linux**, or whatever else. There is a lot out there to talk 
about.


##Things I like

I don't care what anyone says, I'm going to share the cool stuff that I find
and no one can stop me. Here are just a couple of things/places that I think 
are really awesome.


####[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

First entry? Jekyll. It's a cool tool for creating content-driven websites, 
blogs, or whatever without the need for a database or some complex server-side 
setup. It's really neat, and what I'm using for the blog on this site.
