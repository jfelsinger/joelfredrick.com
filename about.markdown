#About

Hey there, Welcome to the site. I'm a developer, writer, and self-proclaimed
cool dude living in the Florida panhandle. I've been working with the web and
related technologies for two years, and have gotten my hands dirty in everything
from asp.net to node.js. I love the web as a platform and could argue best
practices all day. I also love to hear from people, so
[send me a line](/contact.html) some time.

If you're looking for a list of buzz words that I jive with, here's some of my 
favorites:

<div class="grid">
    <ul class="grid__item  one-half">
        <li>Html5</li>
        <li>Css3</li>
        <li>Accessibility</li>
        <li>C# and Asp.Net</li>
        <li>Node</li>
    </ul><!--

        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Linux</li>
        <li>Lamp</li>

        <li>SEO</li>
    </ul>

##Hire Me

If you want to hire me, [let me know](/contact.html). I do general development
with a focus on the web. So if you need a website, a web server, or web application
made and maintained I'd love to hear from you. 


##Things I like

I pretty much don't care what anyone says, you can't stop me from sharing 
all this cool stuff that I love. So here are just a couple of things/places 
that I think are really awesome.


####[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

First entry? Jekyll. It's a cool tool for creating content-driven websites, 
blogs, or whatever without the need for a database or some complex server-side 
setup. It's really neat, and what I'm using for the blog on this site.

####[Inuit CSS](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css)

Basically the only css framework that doesn't torment me with bloat. Inuit
is built modularly on easy to follow conventions with no-frills, minimalistic
styles. A framework after my own heart. Thank you 
[Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com)!

####[Venm](https://github.com/jfelsinger/generator-venm)

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator that I wrote as an alternative to the 
MEAN stack. This one replaces Angular with Vue, because I think Vue is awesome.
