#About

##Hey there,

Welcome to the site. I'm a developer in the rainy land of Southwest Florida. 
I'm a programmer, a bit of a designer, and a guy who really likes the web.
I love **CSS** and **HTML**. They are my weapons 
of choice and what I'll be talking about the most on this blog, but don't be
surprised to see articles on **VIM**, **Linux**, or 
whatever else. There is a lot of fun stuff out there to talk about.


##Things I like</h2>

I don't care what anyone else says, I like sharing the cool stuff I find and
no one can stop me. Here are just a couple of things/places that I think are
really awesome.


####[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

Jekyll is a cool tool for creating websites, blogs, or whatever without the 
need for a database or some complex server-side setup. It's really awesome, 
and what I'm using for the blog on this site.


####[Trent Walton's blog](http://trentwalton.com)

Besides being one of the neatest blogs I've ever seen, every post on Trent
Walton's blog is *always* chock full of insightful information. He
covers a wide range of topics, and really makes me think about the approach
that I take in web-design.


####[Atomic Design](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

The Atomic Design structure is really great, and I'm loving using it. It's
a way of structuring your sass (or css) that makes everything really easy to
find. I can hardly think of a better way to go about organizing the styles
for a large project.
